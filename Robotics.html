        <h1>Robots</h1>
        <section>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                <p>Robot is a word which comes from the Czech word “robota”, which means “forced work or labor”. Robots are practically 
                    just machines, some talk to us, some listen to us, perform tasks as we ask, as well as solve problems without be 
                    specified what direction from a user. Though, the most common uses of a robot have them acting as substitutes, or 
                    mechanical replacements for human labor, doing work for humans that robots would be better suited for, whether it’s 
                    a dangerous environment, difficult environment or just a plain boring one. Most robots are made to do repetitive 
                    actions, or tasks, which is the action of doing one task over and over again. In most cases, a human would slowly 
                    go insane at the thought of tightening a screw over and over for hours and hours, but a robot would do it without 
                    a second thought, let alone a single one. Examples of these could include how robots are used in factories for 
                    building things like cars, candy bars and other electronics. They are also mostly used in jobs which would be 
                    considered or classed as “too dangerous” for humans. An example of this could be a scouting drone which would be used 
                    to enter a building and, as the name suggests, scout a possible bomb threat location in the place of a human risking 
                    their own life to do the same. Robots are also used for medicinal purposes, military tactics, finding objects underwater 
                    and even now are being used to explore other planets in the solar system. Robotic engineering has helped people who have
                    suffered great physical losses, whether it’s an arm or a leg, and overall robots are a great tool to help mankind. 
                    Although robots seem like a modern-day invention, the truth is that evidence suggests automations were created so far
                    back as to the 1400s, ranging from simple toys to parts for religious ceremonies in ancient Greece and Rome. Jaques 
                    de Vaucanson was famous in the 18th century for his robotic invention of a human figure which played the flute and 
                    a robotic duck with an ability to flap its wings. These early robots were often controlled by ropes, wheels, air or 
                    water. There have been countless creations of robots through out history, though in the earlier times they were 
                    mostly created for entertainment purposes. Elektro was the first speaking humanoid robot, built in 1939, who could 
                    speak 700 words and perform tasks such as blowing up balloons. By the 1960s, robots were introduced into the General
                    Motors automobile plant in New Jersey for moving car parts from one place to another. Robots have continued to 
                    advance over the years and have been a part of countless homes for many years. Some examples of robots which could 
                    be found in your house are toys, vacuums and even as programmable pets. Modern day robots are a part of many aspects
                        of industry, medicine, science, space exploration, construction, food packaging, and now they’re even being used to
                        perform surgery, to remove the risk of a human mistake. There are some robots with facial expressions, unmanned 
                        aerial vehicles (UAVs) that monitor hurricanes, robotic bees that help with crop pollination, and much more. The 
                    science of robotics will continue to advance, and it is safe to assume that we haven’t even scratched the surface
                    of what robotic engineering can achieve. A big reason robots tend to be used instead of humans is because it’s 
                    often cheaper to use them instead of humans. It is easier to have robots do some jobs, and sometimes using robots
                      is the only possible way to accomplish a certain task or requirement.</p>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>The impact of robots and robotic engineering tend to be positive. Robots are made to be helpful and to make the 
                completion of tasks and requirement more effective and more efficient than if they were to be attempted by their 
                human counterpart. Robots are especially useful in space exploration because, unlike human explorers, they can 
                survive in space for long periods of time and can safely do things that humans would be rendered unable to do. 
                They can be built to do things that would be considered too risky or rather impossible for astronauts, for example, 
                they can withstand harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures on distant planets, or high levels of radiation in a 
                factory hazard. The robots are able to collect samples, take measurements and send pictures of their surroundings back 
                to Earth. Some computers and robots have been developed to act with human-like behavior. A machine with artificial 
                intelligence is one that can perceive its environment and change its behavior accordingly, while using tools at hand 
                to solve problems or reach goals it has been programmed to achieve with its ability to comprehend and decipher the data
                it witnesses. Though, unlike in many of the popular movies, robots are unable to think or make decisions without human
                input; rather, they are tools to help us get things done, like a screwdriver. Robots are machines with programmed 
                movements that allow them to move in certain directions or move with certain sequences. Though artificial intelligence
                has enabled robots to process information and to learn, they are still limited by the information which they are 
                given. The problems they are instructed to solve and the functions they are programmed to perform. </p>

        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>Robots affect me in my day-to-day life, I use robots daily. Robots are everywhere in our daily lives and have an 
                impact on the lives of almost everyone nowadays. Though it’s a controversial opinions, I believe a mobile phone 
                is a robot and most people in our modern society both own and use a mobile phone throughout their daily lives and 
                routine, whether it’s to contact another person, or to check the weather,  or watch videos online or even to play 
                some videogames to pass the time. </p>
