                                <section> 
                                    <p>Simply put, cybersecurity is the information technology field that focuses on protecting networks, systems, and 
                                        data, including personal and corporate information from threats that expose vulnerabilities in systems and exploit 
                                        them, usually done over the internet. This is done through firewalls, antivirus software, encryption tools, and 
                                        anonymity tools such as proxy servers and virtual private networks (VPNs). As technology develops, many new developments 
                                        are implemented into the world of cybersecurity, for not only protection but also to be utilised as means of breaching 
                                        security systems.</p>
                                    <p>One of the largest innovative technologies that is slowly being implemented into the world of cybersecurity is artificial 
                                        intelligence and machine learning. This not only includes security features that are already implemented into technology 
                                        such as face recognition, but it is also being developed into security systems that learn and develop new methods of threat
                                         detection and prevention (Ziomek, 2021). AI has the potential to learn from current and previous data such as historic 
                                         attacks and prevention methods and develop methods to not only understand future attacks but also prevent the attack in 
                                         whole with no interaction from people, aside from the initial setup of the system. Current methods of cybersecurity are 
                                         considered rigid and not capable of adapting to new or different types of attacks, whereas machine learning can recognise
                                          patterns and adapt its own capabilities and operations as it sees fit (Kangas, 2022). Being a computer, the decision making 
                                          of artificial intelligence is far faster than a human’s, meaning the prevention of attacks can take place much faster than 
                                          it could if it was done by a person. The impact of this is a potential for a future of much stronger defense systems, as 
                                          well as much less monitored systems, with less interaction required, only ever needed for checkups and data entry to allow 
                                          the algorithm to further develop. While this will bring a new wave of security methods, it will also bring about new 
                                          developments in the breaching of these systems. While the systems will be designed to adapt to different approaches, 
                                          it’ll require pre-existing knowledge to develop prevention methods such as that. </p>
                                    <p>Blockchain technologies are a relatively modern technological breakthrough popularized through cryptocurrency mining that has 
                                        been implemented into the field of cybersecurity. They involve storing data in “blocks” between systems and devices and connecting 
                                        them through cryptography chains (IBM, 2021). This works similarly to a peer-to-peer network in which data is shared between 
                                        devices. This effectively makes it much more secure as there is not only one network to breach, but many would need to be breached 
                                        to collect all the data. Blockchain networks can be either public, such as cryptocurrency, or private, such as a business system. 
                                        This technology in terms of cybersecurity will likely not be very applicable for personal security and would better suit a business 
                                        protecting its data amongst multiple servers. As of now, the technology is not utilised as much as it could be, due to the high 
                                        cost of setting it up as it requires multiple servers to distribute the data between. It is also significantly less efficient than
                                         typical security methods, due to classical methods typically requiring a single server with protection through firewalls and 
                                         encryption. If blockchain were to be more easily accessible for business, it would pave way for a new form of security that would 
                                         be far more secure than classic methods. Unfortunately, this technology would likely not be appropriate for personal security and 
                                         networks, as most personal systems do not have a decentralized network to share the data between. </p>
                                    <p>A Zero Trust security system method turns the traditional approach on its head. Traditionally, security models rely on verification, 
                                        but trusting the user first. This is shorthanded to the term ‘trust but verify’ (Loten, 2019).</p>
