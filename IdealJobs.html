    <p>From the table it is highlighted that each group members ideal job is unique,
      with everyone having differing interests in IT. While Jaideep, John G, John A., 
      and Anthony’s jobs all focus on the development and maintenance of a system within 
      a company, Alexander’s preferred ideal role is more radical as it focuses on the much more 
      modern position of a professional e-sports athlete, which often is next to impossible to 
      reach in terms of development as it not only requires high skill, but also luck. Skills and 
      experience involved in the other jobs are much more development and experience focused and are 
      not as much limited by other abilities such as competence in gaming. While Jaideep, John G., John A. 
      and Anthony’s ideal jobs are all involved in the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems in IT,
      all are very different fields. Jaideep’s role is primarily focused on databases and management of a team of 
      developers but can be done remote which is his ideal situation for him. John G.’s position prioritises 
      his goal of working in the automotive industry, which will focus likely on the advancements in the industry 
      such as artificial intelligence and modifications of ECU’s (Engine Control Units). John A.’s position is
      based on his interest in security and with the advancements of IT being implemented into the world of 
      cybersecurity. Anthony’s position is funnelled from his love of helping others with his IT skills, 
      solving complex computer system problems, and developing solutions where required. Emilys role is
      focused on perfecting the user experience by designing, developing, and implementing the front-end 
      of systems. All these roles are unique yet share some similarities and crossovers between skills required.
