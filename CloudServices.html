    <h1>Cloud Services</h1>
    <section> 
        <h3>What does it do? </h3>
            <p>Cloud Services are a digital flow of user data from users through the internet, 
                which goes through to the providers and back. Cloud Services are easily accessible 
                from almost any piece of electronic with internet connection. Cloud Services are an 
                environment that collects and shares resources across a network. They allow for cloud
                computing which is having workloads run within a cloud environment. In Cloud Services, 
                the hardware and application software platform are provided by another party. Like all 
                IT solutions, cloud services rely on hardware and software to operate. Though, differing 
                from hardware and software solutions, users won’t need anything other than a computer, 
                network connection, and an operating system with the ability to access Cloud Services. 
                Cloud Service providers can also use their hardware to create cloud platforms, which are 
                online cloud environments where users can develop code or run applications. To build a cloud 
                platform, it would require more than just abstracting a computer’s capabilities from its hardware. 
                Providing a cloud platform requires multiple levels of development to incorporate technologies, 
                mainly orchestration, application programming interfaces (API’s), routing, security management 
                and automation. When creating a navigable online experience, something important to consider is 
                user experience design (UX). A cloud server is created through virtualization. A management 
                software called a hypervisor is installed on physical servers to connect and virtualize them. 
                The virtual resources are able to be made automatic and be delivered over the cloud for shared 
                use whether its for a single organization, or across multiple which come across it. When a computing 
                resource is said to be "in the cloud”, that usually refers to meaning that it has delivered over a network 
                like the internet, as opposed to having been located on the premises and accessed directly. A difference 
                between a cloud server and a traditional server, is that the cloud has come to be related to the internet 
                in general. There are many clouds, both public and private, which are usually formed by any set of connected 
                servers that are able to deliver computing resources over a network. A cloud server has the ability to be 
                contrasted with a traditional and dedicated server. A cloud server’s resources can be shared by many users, 
                whereas a dedicated server is designed to be exclusively used by one particular party, making for the need 
                for it to be set up and managed by a single organization, but a cloud server has the ability to be owned and 
                managed through the use of a third party. Benefits that cone with the use of cloud servers, include affordability, 
                convenience, scalability and reliability. Using the cloud servers which are managed by the third-party providers,
                it would be a lot less expensive for a company than purchasing and having to maintain their own online dedicated 
                server. The organizations which use a cloud server would benefit from sharing server resources with others and 
                would only have to pay for the resources which their organization uses. The public cloud resources are easily 
                managed through the use of an API or control panel. When the use of maintaining complex infrastructures on 
                the premises by the IT teams involved are no longer required, their resources would be freed up for other 
                tasks. It should also be noted that the users of the cloud services have the ability to access the data 
                from anywhere across the globe. Cloud servers have the ability to respond quickly to demands of storage 
                change, with the ability to scale up or down to meet the demand. Cloud servers have the ability to deliver 
                the same performance as a dedicated server. While the cloud runs on multiple servers in a shared online 
                environment, the service can continue even if a single component were to fail.</p>

         <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
            <p>Impacts of cloud services and servicing have reduced IT costs. Moving to cloud computing would reduce 
                the cost of maintaining and managing your own and/or your organizations IT systems. Instead of purchasing 
                expensive systems and equipment for you and your organization, you have the ability to reduce your expenses
                by using the resources of the cloud computing service provider. You would have the ability to reduce the 
                cost of operations because the cost of system update and upgrades, such as new hardware and new software 
                may be included in your contract, you would no longer need to pay the wages of experienced and expert staff,
                the cost of your energy consumption would be reduced and there would be a lot fewer time delays in
                information and data transfer. Another benefit of using the cloud services would mean that you have 
                access to automatic updates for your organizations IT requirements which would be included in your service
                fee. Depending on the cloud computing service provider your organization is with, your systems would be 
                regularly updated with the latest technology. This would include up to date versions of software, as well 
                as constant upgrades to your servers and computer processing power. </p>

         <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
            <p>Me personally, I use cloud services daily. In most things internet related in our modern times, the cloud 
                services are in use. Every day I spent playing videogames online with my friends, all the data which is 
                created and saved from the use of my time playing is recorded and stored into the cloud services with is 
                then saved and accessed for the next time I log onto the game to play. Another advantage of cloud servicing 
                which I use constantly is the ability to access my data from anywhere, whether its for storing or accessing 
                my data. A disadvantage of cloud servicing which could possibly affect me, is that having my personal data 
                on the cloud could lead to my data being leaked if the security of the cloud is breached by an outside party. 
                As a whole, the cloud isn’t going to be going away and with time, and improved internet connection speeds, 
                along with the fears about security fading, the use of cloud services is set to constantly grow over the years. </p>
