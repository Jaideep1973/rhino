        <h1>Blockchains and Cryptocurrency</h1>
            <section> 
                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    <p>Blockchains is the technology that supports digital currency (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc). 
                    The technology allows for the transfer of digital information, while preventing copying of that
                    information, meaning that each piece of information distributed across the blockchain can only 
                    have a single owner. Additionally, cryptocurrency is any form of currency that exists digitally, using 
                    cryptography (secure communication) to secure transactions. It is a peer-to-peer digital payment system 
                    meaning it does need a third party (such as banks) for verification, instead enabling anyone to send and 
                    receive payments. </p>
                    <p>Current Blockchain technology is built open 4 principles, 1. It is a distributed ledger, meaning everyone on
                    the system has individual open access to information, 2. Cryptographic functions ensure the security of the 
                    system, 3. There is no need for third party authorisation, as participants confirm changes directly to one 
                    another, and number 4. Ability to run smart contracts, which are programs which run when predetermined conditions
                    (set by computer code), are met.  There is not a single version of what a blockchain looks like, they can be 
                    open or controlled, and new and different blockchains are created every day. The best known public blockchain,
                    underlies bitcoin.  </p>
                    <p>Currently there is a diverse number of industries which use blockchain industries, these include the automotive 
                    industry, banking and finance, healthcare and sciences, supply chains, retail and consumer goods, manufacturing, 
                    travel and transportation, and telecommunications.  </p>

                    <p>It is evident that blockchains and cryptocurrencies are here to stay, experts say that within the next 10 years 
                    digital assets will be a solid alternative to flat currencies in the global market. NFTS (Non- Fungible- Tokens).
                    NFTs are surging new way of buying and selling digital assets that represent real world items, which could generate
                    a whole new way of buying and selling digital collectibles, such as artworks, unique merchandise, sneakers, and more. 
                    Cryptoplasm.io Data shows that in 2021, in just two months, there was almost 400$ in gross sales, this trend is likely 
                    to continue within the near future.</p>

                    <p>Due to the secured nature of blockchain technologies, it makes it extremely difficult for hackers to manipulate 
                    transactions and obtain information. Because the data used in blockchain technologies is so secure, banking and 
                    financial services are moving to implementing these technologies, it is predicted that within the next 3 years almost
                    66% of banks will have bitcoin solutions implemented. Current banking drawbacks such as maintenance issues, bank hours,
                    and verification all slow down transactions, with blockchains consumers will have 24/7 instant transactions, anywhere.</p>

                    <p>Blockchain technology can also be extremely useful in the medical industry. Healthcare providers and hospitals will 
                        be able to instantaneously exchange data, reducing redundancies and improving the speed of patient diagnosis, while 
                        also maintaining customer health privacy. Infact blockchains can also be used to fight counterfeit medication, 
                        improve drug safety, and monitor the supply chain. According to grandviewresearch.com the global market size of 
                        blockchain technology in healthcare is expected to increase 63% over the next six years.  </p>

                    <p>In real estate, proving and identifying identity is a slow and tedious process, which can take weeks for banks to 
                        complete processes. Through smart contracts, self-executing contracts would be able to perform any number of 
                        preprogramed tasks, including processing loan requests and verifying bank details. Other possibilities include 
                        managing property records and improving transaction transparency. </p>

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                    <p>Blockchains has the potential to impact all record-based processes. In terms of job redundancy almost any job which 
                        is revolved around the movement of money, both physical and electronic will no longer be necessary. Additionally, 
                        a lot of office paperwork associated with the verification of funds will be eliminated by blockchain tech. However, 
                        The Future of Job Reports predicts that companies shifting task allocation and juggling of roles in the workplace 
                        will yield an overall Net Positive return in employment, they wager that 75 million jobs will be displaced by rising
                        technologies, but it will also make room for an additional 130 million roles.  Individuals most impacted by 
                        blockchains, will be business owners. As owners it is important to understand new technologies so that the business
                        can run optimally and efficiently, failure to do these risks falling behind competition. Therefore, business 
                        owners will need to familiarise themselves with Blockchains, and how they can implement it in their company or 
                        organization, back-office activities such as financial reporting and tax preparation may change, additionally 
                        current and future employees may need to be trained so that they can be familiar with blockchains. In real 
                        estate, intermediaries such as brokers, lawyers, and banks, will have less or changed roles with blockchain 
                        technology, reducing costs and ensuring that buyers and sellers get more out of their money as they save on 
                        commissions and fees charged by intermediaries.  Social impact can also be positively impacted by Blockchain, 
                        for example IBM has started using blockchain to provide a transparent supply chain for produce, building trust 
                        with the public, in terms of healthcare, medical records and treatments can be safely and more efficiently stores,
                        and instantly available in emergency situations, greatly aiding those who undergo constant medical treatment.  </p>

                <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p>On a personal note, cryptocurrency and blockchains have impacted me as I have started researching investing in 
                    crypto, in terms of affect it may impact me financially in a positive way. My father is a manager at a 
                    warehouse distribution centre, part of his duties includes managing product origins, traceability, and 
                    potential recalls. While blockchain is still relatively new, with transparency and the instant data transfer, 
                    my dad as a manger, will be able to better manage production, be able to see consumer level demand in real 
                    time, allowing for better prediction of demand. With this my dad and other managers can ensure that they have 
                    right type and quantity of stock needed to meet expected demand, making it possible to optimize revenue and 
                    profitability.  </p>
